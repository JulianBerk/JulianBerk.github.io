          <h5 class="text-center"> Harold Ickes Playground </h5>
          <p>
            Just a ten minute walk away from my house stands the lot. A giant square of concrete and black fencing, the pavement is cracked and splinters across its surface. Small weeds sprout from wherever they can, inbetween cracks of concrete, or in the unruly mess that exists in the lot's unkempt planters. Standing inside the lot, it seems to stretch for a mile, the concrete surface never-ending, even if you're squinting to see the other side. A rusted and paint peeled sign rests against the inside of the fence, over where the gate to enter is. Upon further inspection, it can be read in its faded font as “Harold Ickes Playground.” Now there's a name for this “playground”. The only part that could perhaps be considered a place for children to play is the concrete baseball diamond jammed into a corner of the lot. Worn and faded, here too, cracks divide the smooth pavement into millions of shapes.

            I have countless vivid memories of myself here, but none stick out as much as the one of a man and his dog. I cross the street, not checking for traffic, I know there won't be any this late at night. I make it to the gate, pushing it open, I feel the cold twinge of metal against my bare fingers. I step into the park, now staring out at the empty expansive lot. Asphalt beneath my feet stretches out across the entirety of the park, where it eventually meets the feet of another man, and the paws of a dog.

            It was a stout dog, a pitbull, it seemed to lock eyes with me the second I stepped into the lot. Its gaze unwaveringly still, not even a twitch in the eye. I snapped out of my daze and focused my attention on the owner.  A middle aged man, with graying hair and earmuffs, he wore a thick wool overcoat. His dress pants shot out from under the coat, and I could see he was wearing a pair of loafers. I raised my hand, and shook it side to side, signaling a gesture of friendliness to the man. He pulled a hand from his coat pocket, and I could see now that it was gloved, as he returned the wave. I now turned, and made my way over to one of the park's many benches. Rigid and plastic, the laminated wood cold against my body as I slump against the bench. I often find myself alone here on a frigid Saturday night, free to close my eyes and listen to the city sound.

            Tonight is different, tonight I can focus on something in front of me, something I have never paid much attention to. The relationship between this man and his dog.
	It's almost the same as the relationship New Yorkers have with the city. We adore our city, and we love it for its many aspects. We are secure in our relationship, the same in the way a person and their dog is connected. The city provides us with an unmatched feeling, which is the reason why many New Yorkers are so motivated to maintain their relationships with the city, regardless of its downsides. Walking the dog, the same as walking to work. Dog curled up on your couch against you, the same as that random man leaning on your side, eyes shut, sleeping on the 4 or 5 train.
